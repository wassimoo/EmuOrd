// Earliest deadline first (EDF) or least time to go is a dynamic scheduling algorithm
// used in real-time operating systems to place processes in a priority queue.
// Whenever a scheduling event occurs (task finishes, new task released, etc.)
// the queue will be searched for the process closest to its deadline.
// This process is the next to be scheduled for execution.
